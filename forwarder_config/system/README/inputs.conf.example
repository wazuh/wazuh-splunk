# Enable Windows Registry monitoring (Windows only)
# This example shows how to enable Windows Registry monitoring as a scripted input.
# Because the Windows Registry can generate a high volume of events, Windows
# Registry monitoring is also affected by two other configuration files,
# sysmon.conf and regmon.conf:
# * sysmon.conf contains global settings for which event types (adds, deletes,
#   renames, and so on) to monitor, which regular expression filters from the
#   regmon-filters.conf file to use, and whether or not Windows registry events
#   are monitored at all.
# * regmon-filters.conf contains the specific regular expressions you create to
#   refine and filter the hive key paths you want Splunk to monitor.
# Splunk recommends that you refer to the documentation about Windows Registry
# monitoring at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/MonitorWindowsregistrydata
# for more details.  You must make the change shown below in inputs.conf in
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/.  You must restart Splunk to enable
