# Specify a target group for an IP:PORT which consists of a single receiver.
# This is the simplest possible configuration; it sends data to the host at
# 10.1.1.197 on port 9997.

[tcpout:group1]
server=10.1.1.197:9997


# Specify a target group for a hostname which consists of a single receiver.

[tcpout:group2]
server=myhost.Splunk.com:9997


# Specify a target group made up of two receivers.  In this case, the data will
# be distributed using AutoLB between these two receivers.  You can specify as
# many receivers as you wish here. You can combine host name and IP if you
# wish.
# NOTE: Do not use this configuration with SplunkLightForwarder.

[tcpout:group3]
server=myhost.Splunk.com:9997,10.1.1.197:6666


# You can override any of the global configuration values on a per-target group
# basis.  All target groups that do not override a global config will inherit
# the global config.

# Send every event to a receiver at foo.Splunk.com:9997 with a maximum queue
# size of 100,500 events.

[tcpout:group4]
server=foo.Splunk.com:9997
heartbeatFrequency=45
maxQueueSize=100500

# Send data to a receiving system that controls access by tokens.
# NOTE: token value is encrypted. Encryption is done by REST endpoint while saving.
[tcpout:group4]
server=foo.Splunk.com:9997
token=$1$/fRSBT+2APNAyCB7tlcgOyLnAtqAQFC8NI4TGA2wX4JHfN5d9g==

# Clone events to groups indexer1 and indexer2. Also, index all this data
# locally as well.

[tcpout]
indexAndForward=true

[tcpout:indexer1]
server=Y.Y.Y.Y:9997

[tcpout:indexer2]
server=X.X.X.X:6666


# Clone events between two data balanced groups.

[tcpout:indexer1]
server=A.A.A.A:1111, B.B.B.B:2222

[tcpout:indexer2]
server=C.C.C.C:3333, D.D.D.D:4444

# Syslout output configuration
# This example sends only events generated by the splunk daemon to a remote
# syslog host in syslog-compliant format:

[syslog:syslog-out1]
disabled = false
server = X.X.X.X:9099
type = tcp
priority = <34>
timestampformat = %b %e %H:%M:%S


# New in 4.0: Auto Load Balancing
#
# This example balances output between two indexers running on
# 1.2.3.4:4433 and 1.2.4.5:4433.
# To achieve this you'd create a DNS entry for splunkLB pointing
# to the two IP addresses of your indexers:
#
#   $ORIGIN example.com.
#   splunkLB A 1.2.3.4
#   splunkLB A 1.2.3.5

[tcpout]
defaultGroup = lb

[tcpout:lb]
server = splunkLB.example.com:4433
autoLB = true

# Alternatively, you can autoLB sans DNS:

[tcpout]
defaultGroup = lb

[tcpout:lb]
server = 1.2.3.4:4433, 1.2.3.5:4433
autoLB = true


# Compression
#
# This example sends compressed events to the remote indexer.
# NOTE: Compression can be enabled TCP or SSL outputs only.
# The receiver input port should also have compression enabled.

[tcpout]
server = splunkServer.example.com:4433
compressed = true


# SSL
#
# This example sends events to an indexer via SSL using splunk's
# self signed cert:

[tcpout]
server = splunkServer.example.com:4433
sslPassword = password
sslCertPath = $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/server.pem
sslRootCAPath = $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/ca.pem

#
# The following example shows how to route events to syslog server
# This is similar to tcpout routing, but DEST_KEY is set to _SYSLOG_ROUTING
#

# 1. Edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/props.conf and set a TRANSFORMS-routing
#    attribute:
[default]
TRANSFORMS-routing=errorRouting

[syslog]
TRANSFORMS-routing=syslogRouting

# 2. Edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/transforms.conf and set errorRouting
#    and syslogRouting rules:
[errorRouting]
REGEX=error
DEST_KEY=_SYSLOG_ROUTING
FORMAT=errorGroup

[syslogRouting]
REGEX=.
DEST_KEY=_SYSLOG_ROUTING
FORMAT=syslogGroup

# 3. Edit $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/outputs.conf and set which syslog
#    outputs go to with servers or groups:
[syslog]
defaultGroup=everythingElseGroup

[syslog:syslogGroup]
server = 10.1.1.197:9997

[syslog:errorGroup]
server=10.1.1.200:9999

[syslog:everythingElseGroup]
server=10.1.1.250:6666

#
# Perform selective indexing and forwarding
#
# With a heavy forwarder only, you can index and store data locally, as well as
# forward the data onwards to a receiving indexer. There are two ways to do
# this:

# 1. In outputs.conf:
[tcpout]
defaultGroup = indexers

[indexAndForward]
index=true
selectiveIndexing=true

[tcpout:indexers]
server = 10.1.1.197:9997, 10.1.1.200:9997

# 2. In inputs.conf, Add _INDEX_AND_FORWARD_ROUTING for any data that you want
#    index locally, and
_TCP_ROUTING=<target_group> for data to be forwarded.

[monitor:///var/log/messages/]
_INDEX_AND_FORWARD_ROUTING=local

[monitor:///var/log/httpd/]
_TCP_ROUTING=indexers
